/*
Write a function getProductsOfAllIntsExceptAtIndex() that takes a vector of integers and returns a vector of the products.

For example, given:

  [1, 7, 3, 4]

your function would return:

  [84, 12, 28, 21]

by calculating:

  [7 * 3 * 4,  1 * 3 * 4,  1 * 7 * 4,  1 * 7 * 3]

Do not use division in your solution.
